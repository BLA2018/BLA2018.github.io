<h1> The story of computer </h1>

<h3>Hello, I am sad to say but I can not introduce myself because I have no name. I have only been given a number. my number is: 94,527. I have always dreamed of having a name a heroic name, something unforgettable, sadly I do not have such a big emagination so I cannot think of anything too well. I am a test subject in the Manrojer Factory, founded by Sir Victor Manrojer great inventor. I do not like it here not even the slightest bit. I have tried to escape many times but this has not worked.Today I shall try to escape for the last time-and if I fail I shall give up and spend the rest of my miserable life here in the factory. This is my plan:
<i> Today me and test subject 90,987 are going to have an examination to see whether we are working well with the knew upgrade writing, as you can see I wil probabbly fail. Anyway We will be escorted to testing room 905. There will be a lot of sheets and cards in this room so I have a lot of things to work with, before the testing starts we have a couple of minutes, I will use this time to cover the cameras and cctv things up with the sheets, after this I will run out taking a bunch of sheets with me to cover more cameras. I will run out and jup out of the helicopter pad-This is very fancy because it is a huge opening that is closed with steal The helipad itself sticks to the wall and comes out only when a helicopter actualy comes. After this everything will fall into place! </i> </h3>
