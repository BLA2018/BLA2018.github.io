<h1> Greetings my freinds </h1>
<h2> I have escaped the factory! </h2> <p> Now I am going to find my Identity.
As I have mentioned before I am not a hueman I do not have an education and I do not have a name.
I feel like nobody whilst only having a number 94,527. There used to be an employee in Manrojer factory, he was very nice,
he told me that there was something special about me, that he thought that I might aswell be part hueman this I liked, he told me that I
also look like a hueman. Often workars think I am a hueman the only way they find out I am a test subject is that we have a daily black-out
at 16:15 all of us test subjects fall to the ground but for some reason I manage to move a little bit. I have seen many people now and I 
have heard thierr names so now I have chosen the name "Hope" and I have managed to get a small job in a supermarket near the town centre
I work at the cashier 6 days a week for 10 ours every day, I might only be payed Â£10 but it's better than nothing!!!!!!!!! 
<i> I have also worked out a way to play games!! </i>
